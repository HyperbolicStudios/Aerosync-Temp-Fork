 This file has several fields, allowing hosts to:
 - Set the game URL
 - Create new phases in the game
 - Delete phases from the game (Ideally, a dropdown of existing phases here)
 - Wipe the game's post/vote data
 - Redirect to the playerlist page
 - If desired, toggle EOD mode - not sure I want this though
