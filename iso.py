# This file contains functions for working with ISOs.

# get_iso takes a list of players (at least one), and returns a list of all posts by those players.
# The list is sorted by post number, with the earliest post first.
# Currently we only support one player, but having a list of players allows for multi-iso in the future.
def get_iso(players, game):
    return NotImplemented

# rank_activity returns a formatted list of strings, where each string is a player's name and the number of posts they have made.
# The list is sorted by the number of posts, with the player who has made the most posts first.
def rank_activity(game):
